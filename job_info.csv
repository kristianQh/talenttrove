See all 16 benefits  Working at Zack Health  See company profile  In a nutshell, Zack Health is a health digital twin that aggregates consumer health data to help track, improve, and predict health outcomes. We are addressing a significant problem in the current healthcare system - See below👇

70% of all deaths in Europe are caused by chronic diseases, costing the healthcare system more than €800 bn every year.

The most effective approach to address chronic diseases is prevention, but only 3% of the European healthcare budget is allocated to preventive care.

This leaves the individual responsible for their own health, which more than 50% also make an effort to do so.

However, the problem is that many of these individuals:
1. Don't find any holistic and convenient solution to quantify their health
2. Feel they are given very generic health advices with less impact
3. Have no clue whether their efforts actually have a measurable impact on their health

We believe that one of the solutions to this problem is a health digital twin that replicates the consumer’s health by aggregating data from blood tests, DNA tests, wearables, lifestyle habits, preferences, and symptom tracking. This data is then analyzed using AI and ML to create hyper-personalized and science-based health plans that help improve and predict health outcomes and prevent diseases.

We take pride in helping more than 2 million users in over 50 countries keep a mileage logbook. No one likes to do mileage documentation - so we try to remove this tedious work and make our customers’ work life simpler by saving them time and money.  We are 28 people doing design, mobile- and web development, marketing, support and customer success in close collaboration.  The product  To the majority of our users, Driversnote is first and foremost a free mobile app they find via App/Play store and install to get automated mileage tracking. They will often start out with motion-based tracking, become aware of free user limitations and become a paying customer on a subscription to remove limitations and get an iBeacon for improved tracking accuracy.  The mobile app is backed by a substantial backend, and at driversnote.com we offer our more advanced users and larger teams a fully fledged web application with advanced trip management, team management and workflows for teams. We have a B2C-like relationship with many of our users, but we are gradually moving more and more into traditional B2B space with all that this entails of further product enhancements.  The way we work  We use a product development process known as Shape Up , where a few key people take the role as shapers and define projects that can be designed, implemented and released within 6 weeks, known as cycles. For each 6 week cycle, we form new cross-functional teams with designers, developers, marketing and customer support people on them, and we let the teams focus exclusively on finishing their projects within the cycle. Each 6 week cycle is followed by a 2 week cool-down period, where we fix bugs, execute functional projects, evaluate how we did and plan the next cycle.  We’ve learned that people thrive on being able to choose freely when they want to work from the office and when they want to work from home, and after our onboarding period you will also be free to work as you prefer. However, working fully remotely is not an option for this position.  We like to say that our unfair advantage is that we care more than our competition, and our users and customers tend to agree when they review our app, respond to NPS surveys and rate our support. We also care a lot about our employees, and between each cycle the entire company has a Team Health Check together, where we rate and discuss how we work together and thrive in our roles. We have a generous budget set aside for each employee to learn and develop, and we try to do a lot of fun stuff together.  The opportunity  We are very data-driven at Driversnote, and with over 2 million users to learn from, that's not just something we say. Data is at the heart of every decision we make, yet we do not have anyone on the team fully dedicated to understanding our data and making the most of it. To us, every change is an experiment and a chance to learn, but we are at a level now where it makes sense to have a data specialist that also understands our business to join us. The infrastructure is already in place: We use BigQuery as our data warehouse, and use Looker Studio to create reports and dashboards, so it’s possible to dive right into our data.  The role  As our new data analyst, you will:   Work directly with our management team and the rest of the company to generate insights from our data.  Be responsible for our data warehouse with support from our developers.  Identify new opportunities for learning and helping our users based on our data.  Analyses data to find insights and assess the impact of recent experiments.  Support the product, operations and marketing teams in setting up reporting.  Build, update and customise data sources.   We’d like you to come with a “can-do” spirit, eager to help with anything we might throw at you and be ready to see how a popular, growing SaaS business really works from the inside.  You must:   Have experience with BigQuery or a similar SQL-based data platform.  Have knowledge of data science, business intelligence or data warehousing from either previous job or your study.  Be detail oriented, highly structured and good at familiarising yourself with complex tasks.  Be fluent in spoken and written English and have clear written communication skills.  Have worked with data from Google Analytics, Firebase or similar platforms.   It would be nice if you:   Have experience with Looker Studio or similar reporting tools.  Have worked at a tech startup before.  Have worked with financial data before.  Basic understanding of marketing channels and attribution.   Danish language skills are not a requirement as our office language is English, but you must be able to work from our office in Copenhagen and have a Danish work permit.  What we believe in  Vision & mission: We work to eliminate work-life hassles to let people focus on what matters. Today, that means removing the pain and trivial work of handling mileage, while providing peace of mind that nothing is forgotten and all rules are followed.  Product-led: We focus our work on the end-user and optimise for bottom-up adoption. People's use of our product is what leads to our growth. We sell through our product and as self-service. We invest in customer success instead of outbound sales. Our marketing is focused on people with a need, leading them to the product.  Lean & data-driven: We try to get a deep understanding of the problems we’re solving. But we also acknowledge that we often can’t predict the outcome of our work. So we believe in an experiment-based approach to product development with short build-measure-learn cycles. For this reason, we also don’t believe in detailed plans for more than 3 months ahead.  Long-term & compounding: We invest in things that will have a continuous return and compound. We e.g. prefer a 1% improvement of activation rate over a €100k deal. We’re self-funded, so we don’t stress about the next funding round, and take the time to go into depth with our work.  What we offer  At Driversnote you will be part of a team composed of talented people that are fun to be around. You will have ample opportunity to influence decisions at all levels, and we hope we can both teach you something and learn something new from you. You’ll get to work with and learn from a team of highly experienced entrepreneurs and tech people. We’ll set aside resources for independent skill development to help you grow and develop your career.  We work in a relaxed environment with new offices near The Meatpacking District. We have tasty freshly cooked lunch every day, great coffee, cozy Friday drinks, and great events from our running club, gaming nights and of course epic Christmas and summer parties - that we hope you will help plan.  Since many of us have spouses and kids that we enjoy spending time with, we can honestly say that we offer a healthy work-life balance along with a competitive salary and all the benefits you would expect.

We have a very high NPS of 71 and customer reviews of 4.8/5 on G2.  ⬇ Below, you find much more info and the apply button ✅  Who are we  On a mission to make video easy for anyone …  Synthesia is the world’s #1 AI video generation platform. Well, it’s actually a video production studio — in a browser. As in, no cameras or film crews at all. You simply choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 60 languages, and your video is ready in minutes. In Synthesia, you can build personalised on-the-fly videos, give your chatbot a human face or run 24/7 weather channels in different languages, to name just a few of the possibilities. 🎬  We believe the future of media is synthetic, and we are on a mission to turn cameras into code and make everyone a creator. Not sure what we’re talking about? Check out our brand video that explains what we’re doing at Synthesia in a way that even our grandparents * kind of * understand what this AI video stuff is all about.  About the position  The Avatars & Voices team is responsible for developing and maintaining our avatar inference, production and customisation as well as text-to-speech and voice cloning. In this role, you will have the opportunity to build a distributed system for user specific voices plus work on scaling the current product and shaping future projects in our pipeline.  We're looking for very Senior / Principal / Staff Engineer-level engineers to take ownership of workstreams and eventually build out teams.   Requirements    You have a minimum of 5+ years of experience working in software development  You have strong computer science fundamentals  You have experience building APIs and integrating with third-party APIs and service providers  You have experience building complex, resilient workflows involving asynchronous jobs on multiple services  You have experience scaling a multi-tenant SaaS backend to handle a large number of concurrent requests  You have a solid understanding of distributed systems and the challenges in scaling a distributed system  Ideally have a high-level understanding of the latest developments in AI and deep learning, especially around generative models for synthesising audio and/or video  Ideally have experience in building a SaaS product that involves handling a large amount of user-submitted audio or video data  Ideally have experience building a SaaS service around a machine learning model  Ideally have experience building a machine learning product with a large number of user-specific models  You are product focused  You have the experience that ranges from early-stage start-ups to bigger, well-established organizations  You like to take ownership of features and execute from planning to production  You are very pragmatic in your approach and you don't over-engineer  You are very good at profiling and debugging performance issues   How we work  We have a fast yet non-hacky development style. We work strictly with product managers who have a technical background. As a result, we do not overwhelm engineers with unrealistic expectations/requirements, and we can therefore move forward much faster. Well, we don’t have unrealistic expectations/requirements in the first place, since we see our roadmap as a set of high-level goals and we have no fixed timelines on deploying features - we want to get things to production as fast as possible. We do that by pushing features behind a feature flag - so not all users see all features, but our production is always updated. This brings zero-downtime deployments, backward compatible features, and similar challenges since our users should never be impacted. Our engineers have one sync meeting per week, async text Slack dailies, we have no dedicated QA people, we work in super small & independent teams, we have no Jira and in our team, we only have engineers, no code monkeys.   For us, it's simple: give people time to do deep work. And help specify features that are limited in scope while discouraging hacky workarounds.   It's early for us and we don't know how right we are yet. But after two years of building our product team and core engineering principles, we can see that we are on the right track. Progress over perfection.    Our stack & some context  We started to work on our main product - Synthesia STUDIO - two years ago with a very small team of engineers (BE and FS). We now have a functional product, that we develop, push forward and improve constantly. While we know, we have a long way to go, to bring our product to where we want it to be, we also have to be mindful of our existing userbase, which is also really involved with us and provides great feedback for each update and new feature we roll out. We have a lot of custom components and multiple layers of complexity, our product is constantly changing but if we try to sum up our stack:    Frontend is TypeScript/HTML/CSS using React.js + Redux;    Backend is a mix of Python, Flask, Node.js (for real-time collaboration), and C++ components (we have our own Chromium fork for headless video rendering) that are mostly containerized with Docker, and hosted on a number of AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS)    We have a dedicated DevOps Engineering team.      The good stuff...  💸 You will be compensated well (salary + stock options + bonus)  📍 You will work in a remote-first environment with offices in 5 locations  🏝 You get 25 days of annual leave + public holidays in the country where you are based  🥳 You will join an established company culture with regular socials and company retreats  🤩 You get 4 weeks paid sabbatical after 4 years at the company + $10,000!!  🍼 You get a paid parental leave  👉 You can participate in a generous referral scheme  💻 You get a brand new computer of your choice (if that still counts as a benefit in 2023 🤔)  🚀 You will have huge opportunities for your career growth    #LI-SI2     Perks and benefits  This job comes with several perks and benefits   Flexible working hours  Time is precious. Make it count. Morning person or night owl, this job is for you.  New tech gear  Are you a true Tech Savvy? Macbook, trackpad, you name it, we get you covered.  Paid holiday  Metropolitists, beach boys and mountaineers we salute you and pay you to go and explore the world.  Skill development  We want to take you from good to great.

Join one of the world leaders in transport and logistics to drive a key delivery for our organisation as a whole.  Here, great colleagues are waiting to welcome you to a vibrant and ever-changing environment where there is room to grow and evolve. What is more, your work will have a direct impact on how we operate across DSV.  Welcome to Data & Information Architecture   Joining Business Continuity Management at our HQ in Hedehusene, you will become a vital member of our Data & Information Architecture team. Here, 5 colleagues are working together to create a new, global data model that is to be used and implemented end-2-end across our entire organisation.

Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the performance and reliability of district heating systems.

See all 16 benefits  Working at Zack Health  See company profile  In a nutshell, Zack Health is a health digital twin that aggregates consumer health data to help track, improve, and predict health outcomes. We are addressing a significant problem in the current healthcare system - See below👇

70% of all deaths in Europe are caused by chronic diseases, costing the healthcare system more than €800 bn every year.

The most effective approach to address chronic diseases is prevention, but only 3% of the European healthcare budget is allocated to preventive care.

This leaves the individual responsible for their own health, which more than 50% also make an effort to do so.

However, the problem is that many of these individuals:
1. Don't find any holistic and convenient solution to quantify their health
2. Feel they are given very generic health advices with less impact
3. Have no clue whether their efforts actually have a measurable impact on their health

We believe that one of the solutions to this problem is a health digital twin that replicates the consumer’s health by aggregating data from blood tests, DNA tests, wearables, lifestyle habits, preferences, and symptom tracking. This data is then analyzed using AI and ML to create hyper-personalized and science-based health plans that help improve and predict health outcomes and prevent diseases.

We have a very high NPS of 71 and customer reviews of 4.8/5 on G2.  ⬇ Below, you find much more info and the apply button ✅  Who are we  On a mission to make video easy for anyone …  Synthesia is the world’s #1 AI video generation platform. Well, it’s actually a video production studio — in a browser. As in, no cameras or film crews at all. You simply choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 60 languages, and your video is ready in minutes. In Synthesia, you can build personalised on-the-fly videos, give your chatbot a human face or run 24/7 weather channels in different languages, to name just a few of the possibilities. 🎬  We believe the future of media is synthetic, and we are on a mission to turn cameras into code and make everyone a creator. Not sure what we’re talking about? Check out our brand video that explains what we’re doing at Synthesia in a way that even our grandparents * kind of * understand what this AI video stuff is all about.  About the position  The Avatars & Voices team is responsible for developing and maintaining our avatar inference, production and customisation as well as text-to-speech and voice cloning. In this role, you will have the opportunity to build a distributed system for user specific voices plus work on scaling the current product and shaping future projects in our pipeline.  We're looking for very Senior / Principal / Staff Engineer-level engineers to take ownership of workstreams and eventually build out teams.   Requirements    You have a minimum of 5+ years of experience working in software development  You have strong computer science fundamentals  You have experience building APIs and integrating with third-party APIs and service providers  You have experience building complex, resilient workflows involving asynchronous jobs on multiple services  You have experience scaling a multi-tenant SaaS backend to handle a large number of concurrent requests  You have a solid understanding of distributed systems and the challenges in scaling a distributed system  Ideally have a high-level understanding of the latest developments in AI and deep learning, especially around generative models for synthesising audio and/or video  Ideally have experience in building a SaaS product that involves handling a large amount of user-submitted audio or video data  Ideally have experience building a SaaS service around a machine learning model  Ideally have experience building a machine learning product with a large number of user-specific models  You are product focused  You have the experience that ranges from early-stage start-ups to bigger, well-established organizations  You like to take ownership of features and execute from planning to production  You are very pragmatic in your approach and you don't over-engineer  You are very good at profiling and debugging performance issues   How we work  We have a fast yet non-hacky development style. We work strictly with product managers who have a technical background. As a result, we do not overwhelm engineers with unrealistic expectations/requirements, and we can therefore move forward much faster. Well, we don’t have unrealistic expectations/requirements in the first place, since we see our roadmap as a set of high-level goals and we have no fixed timelines on deploying features - we want to get things to production as fast as possible. We do that by pushing features behind a feature flag - so not all users see all features, but our production is always updated. This brings zero-downtime deployments, backward compatible features, and similar challenges since our users should never be impacted. Our engineers have one sync meeting per week, async text Slack dailies, we have no dedicated QA people, we work in super small & independent teams, we have no Jira and in our team, we only have engineers, no code monkeys.   For us, it's simple: give people time to do deep work. And help specify features that are limited in scope while discouraging hacky workarounds.   It's early for us and we don't know how right we are yet. But after two years of building our product team and core engineering principles, we can see that we are on the right track. Progress over perfection.    Our stack & some context  We started to work on our main product - Synthesia STUDIO - two years ago with a very small team of engineers (BE and FS). We now have a functional product, that we develop, push forward and improve constantly. While we know, we have a long way to go, to bring our product to where we want it to be, we also have to be mindful of our existing userbase, which is also really involved with us and provides great feedback for each update and new feature we roll out. We have a lot of custom components and multiple layers of complexity, our product is constantly changing but if we try to sum up our stack:    Frontend is TypeScript/HTML/CSS using React.js + Redux;    Backend is a mix of Python, Flask, Node.js (for real-time collaboration), and C++ components (we have our own Chromium fork for headless video rendering) that are mostly containerized with Docker, and hosted on a number of AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS)    We have a dedicated DevOps Engineering team.      The good stuff...  💸 You will be compensated well (salary + stock options + bonus)  📍 You will work in a remote-first environment with offices in 5 locations  🏝 You get 25 days of annual leave + public holidays in the country where you are based  🥳 You will join an established company culture with regular socials and company retreats  🤩 You get 4 weeks paid sabbatical after 4 years at the company + $10,000!!  🍼 You get a paid parental leave  👉 You can participate in a generous referral scheme  💻 You get a brand new computer of your choice (if that still counts as a benefit in 2023 🤔)  🚀 You will have huge opportunities for your career growth    #LI-SI2     Perks and benefits  This job comes with several perks and benefits   Flexible working hours  Time is precious. Make it count. Morning person or night owl, this job is for you.  New tech gear  Are you a true Tech Savvy? Macbook, trackpad, you name it, we get you covered.

Your professional CV comprises:   Expert programming skills in C#  Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)  Experience with development of Windows applications  Experience with Azure DevOps  Knowledge of parallel programming  Good communication skills in English both written and spoken   We expect you to have a technical background in software development for engineering, but we do not expect you to have radar knowledge. The most important thing is that you are motivated for a steep learning curve, we have a tailored introduction ready for you.  It is a requirement for this position that you can obtain a security clearance.    Your new team  Our team consists of 11 highly competent and dedicated colleagues, and we work closely together with the rest of Weibel’s software teams with approximately 50 developers across the different teams.
